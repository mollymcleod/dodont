	<h2>When someone you know has cancer</h2>
	<p>
	When times get tough for friends, family and co-workers, you naturally want to help in any way you can.
	<p>
	Usually all you need to do is provide a sympathetic ear or a shoulder to cry on. Or perhaps a night on the town or a good joke is what it takes. In tougher situations, you might need to decide whether to make a loan or to let someone move into your guest room a while.
	<p>
	That about covers most cases. But forget about "most cases" when it comes to learning that someone you know has cancer.
	<p>
	When this happens, it can seem impossible to know what to say or do, and at the same time it can seem impossible not to say or do something.
	<p>
	The fear, of course, is that you will end up saying or doing the wrong thing at the worst possible time. Afraid of hurting or offending someone at such a sensitive moment, it's easy to feel paralyzed. You simply don't know how to respond.

		When you first learn that a person has cancer, a simple expression of concern can oten be the most meaningful thing you can say, according to "When Someone You Know Has Cancer" and "When Someone You Work With Has Cancer," two ACS documents that Ades has worked extensively on.
		<p>
		Both documents make the point that simple yet heartfelt statements like the following can allow you to:

		<ul id="dos-list">
		<li><div class="tip"><strong>Acknowledge the situation.</strong> Example: "I know this must be hard for you."</div><div class="vote"><a href="#" class="upvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">5</span> <a href="#" class="downvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">2</span></div>
		<li><div class="tip"><strong>Express concern.</strong> Example: I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this.</div><div class="vote"><a href="#" class="upvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">9</span> <a href="#" class="downvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">1</span></div>
		<li><div class="tip"><strong>Offer to listen.</strong> Example: "If you would like to talk about it, I am here."</div><div class="vote"><a href="#" class="upvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">4</span> <a href="#" class="downvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">5</span></div>
		<li><div class="tip"><strong>Offer assistance</strong> Example: "Please let me know if I can help."</div><div class="vote"><a href="#" class="upvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">5</span> <a href="#" class="downvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">6</span></div>

		<li><div class="tip"><strong>Ask how the personfeels.</strong> (Rather than assuming you know how the person feels on any given day.)

		<p>
		It is normal to feel sorry for someone with cancer, or to feel guilty for being healthy. You may feel awkward, especially if you have not had a previous experience with cancer.
		<p>
		Try to be aware of what you're feeling before you interact with someone who has cancer so that you don't say anything you don't mean or that could jeopardize your relationship.
		<p>
		Some common impluses it is better to avoid include:

		<ul id="donts-list">
		<li><div class="tip"><strong>Putting pressure on them</strong>. It can sometimes overwhelm a person with cancer to hear statements like "You're so brave," or "You're too strong to let this beat you," or "Keep a positive attitude." If they're afraid of appearing weak or vulnerable to yopu, they won't be able to communicate honestly.</div><div class="vote"><a href="#" class="upvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">6</span> <a href="#" class="downvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">6</span></div>
		<li><div class="tip"><strong>Commenting on appearance.</strong> Telling someone they look pale or look like they've lost weight isagood way to make them self-conscious or fearful&mdash;and if it's true, it's probably something they already know.</div><div class="vote"><a href="#" class="upvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">1</span> <a href="#" class="downvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">3</span></div>
		<li><div class="tip"><strong>Sharing war stories.</strong> You may know someone else who has had cancer, but it's a mistake to thijnkeveryone's experience will be the same.</div><div class="vote"><a href="#" class="upvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">7</span> <a href="#" class="downvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">3</span></div>
		<li><div class="tip"><strong>Offering unsolicited advice.</strong> Telling people what to do when they don't ask for help is rarely a goodidea, even if your intentions are the best</div><div class="vote"><a href="#" class="upvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">4</span> <a href="#" class="downvote"></a><span class="upvote-count">1</span></div>
